Project Title:The story of Millions In Denied Claims
Introduction:
This project focuses on understanding why healthcare claims get denied, especially those with the CO-119 (Benefit Maximum Reached) denial. Our goal is to explore the data, find patterns, and highlight where insurance companies and treatment categories face the most issues.

What’s Included in This Project
1. Claim Data (CSV File)
This is the main dataset we used. It includes details such as:
Insurance name and type
Treatment category
Billed and allowed amounts
Claim status
Reason codes (including CO-119)
Outstanding amounts
AR status and follow-up details

2. EDA Document
A short report explaining:
How we cleaned the data
Basic patterns in the claims
CO-119 denial trends
Visual insights from the dataset

3. Tableau Dashboards
Interactive visuals showing:
How many claims were denied
How CO-119 denials vary across insurers
Treatment categories with the highest financial loss
Stacked bar charts, tree maps, and trends

4. Python Scripts
Code used for:
Cleaning the data
Handling the duplicates
EDA(Univariate,BiVariate,MultiVariate)

Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – for data cleaning and visuals
Excel – for quick checks and basic exploration
Tableau – for dashboards and interactive analysis

Purpose of the project:
Why certain claims are denied
Which insurance types and treatments face more denials
How CO-119 impacts financial loss
How denial patterns can help improve revenue cycle management
